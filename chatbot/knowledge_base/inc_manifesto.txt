45Introduction
At every stage of its 138-year journey, the Indian National Congress had identified itself with the problems, develop-
ment, aspirations and hopes of all the people of India. During the freedom struggle, its foremost aim was to win
freedom. It was guided by the wisdom and sacrifice of great leaders like Mahatma Gandhi. After independence, the
Congress’ article of faith was the Constitution of India of which Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar was the prime architect.
We reiterate that the
Constitution of India
shall remain our sole
guide and companion
in our never-ending
journey.
Since 1947, the Congress has been India’s beacon of hope. Our policies brought about rapid industrialisation in a
predominantly agrarian economy, transformed India from a famine-struck country to one that exports food grains to
countries around the world, laid the scientific and technical foundations for India’s rise as a global software
powerhouse, and built world class institutions in research and higher education whose graduates are seen as at par
with the world’s best. Even as liberalisation and reforms caused economic growth to boom under successive
Congress governments, our social welfare policies ensured that every citizen was able to participate in the India
story. The social welfare net created by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) such as the Mahatma Gandhi National
Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and the National Food Security Act ensured that India was able to
absorb the shocks of the Global Financial Crisis (2008), the Taper Tantrum (2013), demonetisation (2016) and
COVID-19 (2020).
3Five years ago, on the eve of the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress had published a 54-page manifesto. Based on the
record of the first term of the Modi government, we had forewarned the people of the precarious state of our polity
and economy, and of the danger of re-electing the BJP/NDA government. Our assessment of the situation in the
country has, alas, proved true. Many of the weaknesses and woes have deepened in the last five years. The promises
and assurances that the Congress gave in its 2019 manifesto remain valid and doubly relevant today. Hence, we will
start with endorsing our 2019 manifesto and urge you to read the statements here as part of this manifesto.
We may recall our forewarning
• We had said, “Youth have lost jobs”. The unemployment rate is 8
percent; among graduates the unemployment rate is over 40%.
• We had said, “Farmers have lost hope”. Farmers had to come on to
the streets for 16 months to fight the three farm laws that would have
made them tenant-farmers of corporate houses; and the farmers are
back on the streets again.
• We had said, “Traders have lost business”. The Goods and Services
Tax (GST) laws have squeezed exorbitant tax revenues out of lakhs of
traders and constrained free trade.
• We had said, “Micro, small and medium enterprises have lost their
confidence”. Lakhs of MSMEs have shut down and are no longer
creators of jobs
• We had said, “Women have lost a sense of security”. Crimes against
women have increased by 31 per cent between 2014 and 2022.
• We had said “Deprived communities have lost their economic
rights”. Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Other
Backward Classes (OBC) communities have been deprived of jobs
because of the unfilled vacancies in government and other public
institutions. Tribal people have been denied their rights under the
Forest Rights Act.
• We had said, “Institutions have lost independence”. Every institution,
including Constitutional bodies, has been undermined and, in some
cases, forced to become subservient to the government.
Our greatest concern was the prevailing ‘climate of fear, intimidation and hatred’. In the last five years, every section
of the people has lived in fear; laws and investigating agencies have been weaponised to intimidate people; and
through its words and actions the BJP and its affiliates have spread hatred among people belonging to different
religious, language and caste groups.
Today, the dangers that we had warned against have become a hard reality.
The economy is in a crisis. Despite the claim that India is the fastest growing large economy in the world, our growth
rate has fallen from an average of 6.7 per cent (new series) during the UPA period of 2004-14 to an average of 5.9 per
cent during 2014-24. As against the goal of doubling the economy (which the UPA did achieve), India’s GDP in real
terms will rise from (cid:6)100 lakh crore in 2013-14 to only (cid:6)173 lakh crore in 2023-24, far short of the target.
4The decline in the growth rate has serious consequences for the people, especially for those who belong to the
poor and middle classes. The impact has fallen on per capita income, consumption of goods and services, and
standard of living. Household net assets have declined, household liabilities have increased and families have
borrowed more.
Inequality between the rich on the one hand and the poor and middle classes on the other have increased
sharply dealing a body blow to the goals of equality, equity, and social and economic justice. A report titled
“Income and Wealth Inequality in India, 1922-2023: The Rise of the Billionaire Raj” by leading global economists,
including Thomas Piketty, shows that India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi is more unequal than even
under the British Raj. The share of national income earned by India’s top 1 per cent is today at its highest
historical levels and is among the highest globally. The rise of inequality has been particularly pronounced
between 2014 and 2023.
The numbers of registered and active workers under MGNREGA and the fact that 80 crore people depend on
free grain (5 kg per person per month) are definite indicators of widespread poverty. On the Global Hunger
Index, India’s rank is 111 out of 125 countries.
The gravest danger is that India may no longer be a truly free and democratic republic. Democracy in India has
been hollowed out and we are rapidly sliding to become a one-party and one-person dictatorship. The federal
structure is under attack with the central government appropriating most of the central revenues, passing laws
on subjects that were hitherto left to the state governments, and using its financial and executive powers to
reduce states to municipalities. Governors of non-BJP-governed states are encouraged to paralyse the working
of elected governments. Laws and investigating agencies are used to foist false cases against non-BJP leaders
to force them to submit to the BJP’s will. The media has been rewarded or intimidated to become a vehicle of
propaganda of the government.
Ask yourself two questions:
(1) Is your life better today than what it was in 2014?
(2) Is your mind without fear as dreamed by Rabindranath Tagore?
The choice is not Congress or BJP, but it is more than that. The choice is
Democratic government or Authoritarian rule
Freedom or Fear
Prosperity for All or Wealth for a Few
Justice or Injustice.
The 2024 general election presents an opportunity for radically changing the style and substance of gover-
nance that has been in evidence in the past decade of Anyay Kaal. We appeal to you to look beyond religion,
language and caste, choose wisely, and install a democratic government that will work for all the people of
India. We appeal to you to vote for the INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS.
5EQUITY
Social Justice
Congress has been the most vocal and active champion of the progress of the backward and oppressed classes and
castes over the last seven decades. However, caste discrimination is still a reality. The people belonging to the SC, ST
and OBC communities have not yet been able to catch up with the rest and are still left behind. While OBC, SC and ST
constitute nearly 70 per cent of India’s population, their representation in high-ranking professions, services and
businesses is disproportionately low. No progressive modern society should tolerate such inequality or discrimina-
tion based on ancestry and the consequent denial of equal opportunity. Congress will bridge historical inequities by
implementing the following programme.

The plurality of religions represents the history of
India. History cannot be altered. All people living in
India and all children born in India are equally
entitled to enjoy human rights that includes the
right to practise one’s religion. Pluralism and
diversity constitute the ethos of India and are
enshrined in the Preamble to the Constitution of
India. Given the history and the democratic
traditions of India, the Congress believes that
there is no place for authoritarianism or majoritari-
anism.

HEALTH
Congress was the first political
party to acknowledge that health

the responsibility of the govern-

10YOUTH
Jobs
“The future lies in the youth of today” is particularly relevant for a young nation like India with a median age of just
28 years. The youth of India face joblessness as well as hopelessness. The root cause is massive unemployment
that has got worse every year under the BJP/NDA government. Congress will tackle this issue on a war footing with
a clear Yuva Nyay programme.

11EDUCATION
Education is a public good and every
student has the right to free, quality

colleges and universities should be

by public resources. We recognise that

13SPORTS
No government in India’s independent history
has politicised sports as much as the present
BJP/NDA government. From scheduling World
Cup games in select venues for overt political
purposes to turning a blind eye to harassment
of India’s Olympians by politically-aligned
persons in sports bodies, Indian sports is
arguably going through its worst phase.
Congress believes that Indian sport will soar
only when the autonomy of sports bodies is
restored, political bias is removed, and the
government is a strong and neutral supporting
force for sports development.
1. Congress will take suitable measures to ensure that
the constitution of each sports body is in accordance
with certain norms and principles, that elections are
held according to the constitution of that body and the
recommendations of the Justice Lodha Committee, and
that there is adequate representation in each sports
body for active players, former players and women.
2. Congress will enact a separate legislation for the
registration of sports federations/bodies/associations

5. We will ensure that the principle of ‘Same Work, Same
Wages’ is enforced in order to prevent discrimination in
wages for women.
6. The contribution of the Central government to the pay
of frontline health workers (such as ASHA, Anganwadi,
Mid-Day Meal cooks, etc.) will be doubled.
7. We will substantially increase the amount of institu-

will vastly enhance the credit extended to Self Help
Groups by banks, Non-Banking Financial Companies
and Micro Finance Institutions.
8. The Labour Force Participation Rate of women is
an abysmal 25 per cent. We will embark on a massive
exercise to expand women’s participation in the work-
force through measures such as fair and equal wages;
safe places of work; childcare services; preventing
sexual harassment and violence; and extending materni-
ty benefits.
9. We will re-incorporate the Bhartiya Mahila Bank
(Women’s Bank) that had made a promising start under
an all-Women Board of Directors but was wound up by
the patriarchal BJP/NDA government.
10. In matters of marriage, succession, inheritance,
adoption, guardianship, etc., women and men should
have equal rights. We will review all the laws and ensure
equality between men and women.
16FARMERS
The farmers’ agitations ring the alarm bells to the deep crisis in the agriculture sector.
The BJP/NDA government’s response has been callous and brutal. Farmers do not get fair and remunerative prices
for their produce; nor do the producers have adequate avenues to market their produce. Export controls have debili-
tated farmers. The plight of farm labourers is worse; the work available is irregular and the wages have stagnated for
nearly four years.
Agriculture
Congress is the only party that has lent its ear to the distress call of the farmers and farm labour and we are
determined to do everything possible to alleviate their pain and make agriculture a desirable livelihood.

176. In consultation with farmers’ organizations, we will
make available to farmers three avenues for sale of
agricultural produce:
(a). Regulated Market under the prevailing APMC Act.
(b). E-market that will be operated by an autonomous
body with representation of farmers’ organizations,
Farmer-Producer Organizations (FPOs) and individual
progressive farmers.
(c). Freedom to the farmer to sell agricultural produce
at the farm-gate or at any other place of choice with an
option to upload the sale-and-purchase agreement on a
digital ledger.
7. We will establish farmers’ retail markets in large
villages and small towns to enable the farmers to bring
their produce and sell the same to consumers.
8. Congress will formulate and implement a sound
import-export policy for agricultural commodities, which
will give paramount importance to protecting the
interests and concerns of farmers.
9. We will revive the system of Agricultural Extension

panels connected to tube wells to generate energy.
11. Congress will implement a major initiative to
promote horticulture, pisciculture and sericulture, and
encourage farmers to diversify into these activities and
increase their income.

and poultry in five years.

ensure that one agricultural college and one veterinary
college is established in every district of the country.

five years.

20DEFENDING THE
CONSTITUTION
Saving Democracy, Removing Fear, Restoring Freedom
India’s democracy has been reduced to an empty shell. Every institution, including Parliament, is perceived to have
lost its independence and become subservient to the executive government. It is common knowledge that it is the
will of one person that prevails in the country. People’s trust in democratic institutions will be restored.

REVERSING
THE DAMAGE
In the last 10 years tremendous damage was done
by the BJP/NDA by misusing the brute majority
enjoyed by it in Parliament to make laws that
violated the letter and spirit of the Constitution of
India as well as the fundamental principles of
law-making, namely, necessity, consultation,
reasonableness and proportionality.
We promise that all anti-people laws passed by the
BJP/NDA without proper parliamentary scrutiny
and debate, especially those relating to workers,
farmers, criminal justice, environment & forests
and digital data protection, will be thoroughly
reviewed and changed.
We will carry out complete investigations of the
Electoral Bonds Scam, the reckless sale of public
assets, the PM CARES scam, repeated intelligence
failures at the highest levels and corruption in
major defence deals.
22MEDIA
In the last ten years, significant sections
of the media have been robbed of, or
surrendered, their freedom. Congress will
help the media re-discover the freedom
that they enjoy under the Constitution.

23JUDICIARY
Thanks to the misgovernance, weaponisation of
the laws, misuse of investigating agencies and
abuse of executive powers by the BJP/NDA
government in the last 10 years, the people have
come to look upon the judiciary as the last
bastion against anti-democratic actions and
authoritarianism. An independent judiciary alone
can uphold the Constitution of India.

tance. The Court of Appeal will be the final court of
appeal that will, sitting in Benches of three judges each,
hear appeals from the High Court and National Tribu-
nals.
24ANTI-CORRUPTION
In the last 10 years, we have seen that several measures taken by the BJP/NDA government were actually
a cloak for corruption. Some examples are demonetisation, the Rafale deal, Pegasus spyware, and the
Electoral Bonds scheme. Congress will probe these dubious deals and schemes and bring to law those
who made illegal gains through these measures.
Known offenders were allowed to leave the country in the last 10 years. The BJP/NDA government is
perceived to have facilitated their leaving the country and has not been able to bring back any of the
scamsters. The circumstances under which they were allowed to leave the country will be probed and all
scamsters and their accomplices will be brought before the law.
The BJP has turned out to be a giant washing machine. Accused in registered cases who joined the BJP
were allowed to escape the law. The allegations against such persons will be revived and investigated.
25ART, CULTURE
AND
HERITAGE
Art, culture and heritage constitute the
identity of a people. The BJP/NDA
government has focused on looking at
culture through the lens of politics and
ideology, while the actual practitioners,
practices and institutions of culture have
been neglected or actively undermined.
Congress is committed to protect the
rich diversity of India’s art and culture
and to ensure they thrive in an atmo-
sphere of freedom and creativity.

26ECONOMY
Our Economic Policy
Economic justice is as important as political and social justice. Sound economic policies will ensure that India, a
developing country, will attain the status of, first, a middle-income country and, then, a developed country.
Congress’ economic policy has evolved over the years. In 1991, the Congress ushered in the era of liberalization and
steered the country toward an open, free and competitive economy with regulatory oversight. The country reaped
enormous benefits in terms of wealth-creation, new businesses and entrepreneurs, a huge middle class, millions of
jobs, important innovations in education and healthcare, and exports. Millions of people were lifted out of poverty. We
reiterate our commitment to an open economy in which economic growth will be driven by the private sector comple-
mented by a strong and viable public sector.
TIME FOR A RE-SET
After 33 years, the time is ripe for a re-set of economic
policy. We need a Nav Sankalp Economic Policy. The
cornerstone of the Nav Sankalp Economic Policy will
be JOBS. To create jobs, India must become a
producing economy. We must produce goods and
services for ourselves and for the world. There is a
huge opportunity for India to emerge as the world’s
biggest producer.
We reject jobless growth and the BJP’s legacy of
job-loss growth. We will address the issues of inflation;
extreme poverty among a significant section of the
people; hunger; nutritional deficiency among women
and children; and the growing inequalities of income
and wealth.
The three goals of our economic policy were, and will
be, work, wealth and welfare.
WORK
Work means there will be plenty of jobs and sufficient opportunities for self-employment and starting businesses.
1. We will create thousands of jobs as outlined in the 3. We will remove the current environment of distrust

to meet our twin goals of full employment and high
productivity gains. The Labour Codes passed by the
BJP/NDA government will be reviewed and amended.
28WEALTH
Wealth and wealth creation are the goals of any business.
Industrial and business policies and regulations will be
designed to facilitate the production of goods and services in
larger volumes and higher values. While production is import-
ant, productivity is equally important. Any impediment, legal
or administrative, to larger production or higher value will be
removed. We will facilitate access to finances, raw materials,
technology, intellectual property, and other resources both
from within India and through imports. Business enterprises
will have the liberty to sell goods and services within India or
through exports. All laws and rules that inhibit free and fair
trade will be reviewed and changed.
India’s GDP in 1990-91 was approximately (cid:6)25 lakh crore in
constant prices. In 13 years, first under a Congress govern-
ment and later under coalition governments, the GDP doubled
and reached a value of (cid:6)50 lakh crore in 2003-04. In 10 years
under the UPA, the economy doubled again and the GDP was
at (cid:6)100 lakh crore in 2013-14. A (cid:6)100 lakh crore economy
was inherited by the BJP/NDA government but it wasted the
golden opportunity. If the UPA had continued in office, the
economy would have doubled again and stood at (cid:6)200 lakh
crore in 2023-24. Alas, due to the BJP’s mismanagement, the
GDP will reach a level of only (cid:6)173 lakh crore by the end of
2023-24 falling short of a target that was unachievable.
The Congress is committed to rapid growth and generation of
wealth. We have set a target of doubling the GDP in the next
10 years.
WELFARE
Welfare of all is the goal of all work and the creation of wealth. Owing to the skewed policies of the BJP/NDA, the
people of India are divided in economic terms. There is a small class of very rich, a substantial middle class, a large
segment of people above the poverty line but not yet the middle class, and nearly 22 crore people who are poor.
Under a Congress government, the welfare of the poor will be the first charge on all government resources. It will be
the Congress’ endeavour to ensure that the 22 crore people below the poverty line are lifted above the line in the next
10 years; that they are able to enjoy the fruits of education, healthcare, housing, drinking water, sanitation, electricity
and, above all, opportunities for jobs/work; and are made strong and self-reliant to compete with others who are
higher on the economic ladder.
As people move up the economic ladder, their needs are for better infrastructure and better goods and services.
Besides, we must get the Indian economy and the Indian work force ‘future-ready’. The challenges of the future
include the changes in the global economy, advanced technology such as Artificial Intelligence, robotics and machine
learning, and climate change. The future of our energy is Green Energy. We will mobilize the massive capital required
for our green energy transition.
The Nav Sankalp Economic Policy will aim to build a fair, just and equal-opportunity economy and bring prosperity to
all sections of the people. Congress will herald a new beginning, just as we did in 1991, involving all sections of the
people in nation-building. The time has become to re-set and re-prioritize our roadmap for economic development in
the context of the twin challenges to our economy, namely, UNEMPLOYMENT and INFLATION.
We have made specific promises in different sections of this Manifesto. By implementing these promises, we hope to
achieve the paramount goal of ushering in a fair, just and equitable economy that will make India a rich country, and
that will be resilient to adapt to a changing world.
29UNEMPLOYMENT –
MEETING THE CRY
FOR JOBS
The most challenging issue today is widespread
unemployment. The cry everywhere is for jobs.
The unemployment rate ranges from 10 per cent
(for age 15-29) to 42.3 per cent (for graduates
under age 25) to 9.8 per cent (for graduates of
age 30-34). No one has any faith in the BJP which
deceived the people with the false claim that it
will create 2 crore jobs a year. The BJP/NDA
government’s response to the grave problem was
to abandon labour force surveys, distort data and
pretend that the problem does not exist. We
acknowledge the problem and we promise to
create millions of jobs through concrete initia-
tives:
1.Fill the nearly 30 lakh vacancies in sanctioned posts The programme will be implemented consistent with

in the mineral-rich states.
30TAXATION AND
TAX REFORMS
Taxation forms the core of governance. The
last ten years of the BJP/NDA government is a
case of “taxation gone berserk”. The share of
taxes paid by the common person and the poor
through regressive indirect taxes has increased
significantly and the share of taxes paid by
corporates has decreased – the exact opposite
of what a people-friendly and progressive
taxation policy should be. Despite the tall
claims of increasing the tax base through
demonetistion and GST, India’s overall tax to
GDP has not increased in the last decade,
leaving very little room for increased expendi-
ture. Congress will undertake a complete
overhaul of India’s taxation system to make it
people-friendly and efficient, and to incentivise
private savings and investment.

31INDUSTRY
In order to become a developed economy and create good quality jobs for hundreds of thousands of youth, it
is critical that India transitions from a consumer economy to a producer economy. India must become a
manufacturing powerhouse that produces goods and services for itself and the world. To this end, beyond
economic and business factors, the most vital ingredient is social harmony that will attract investments and
a skilled labour force. It is thus no surprise that in the last 25 years, India’s manufacturing share of GDP has
been higher during the Congress rule. On the contrary, in the last 10 years (2014-24), the share of manufac-
turing has stagnated at 14 per cent.

32INFRASTRUCTURE
The hardware of an economy are roads, railways,
ports, airports and electricity. Capital expenditure
and modern technology have to be mobilized to

3334FEDERALISM
Centre-State Relations
Federalism is the foundational principle of ‘India is a
Union of States’. India’s fabric of federalism stitched
together by mutual trust between the Union and States
has been systematically destroyed by the BJP/NDA
government. Congress affirms its belief that India
cannot be administered by the central government
alone. In most matters concerning the daily lives of the
people, it is the state government that is close to the
people and, in some matters, it is the local government
(panchayats or municipality) that is closer to the people.
1. We will review the distribution of legislative fields in
the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and build a
consensus on transferring some fields from List III
(Concurrent List) to List II (State List).
2. India is one and many at the same time. Its unity gets
strengthened when its diversities are accommodated
and celebrated. This has always been Congress’ stance
and will remain so. Article 1 of the Constitution begins
with the words “India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of
States.” This is the guiding principle of federalism in our
country.
3. Congress will end the duplicitous “cess” raj of the
BJP/NDA government to deny states their rightful share
of tax revenues. We will introduce a law to limit Union
cess and surcharges to 5 per cent of gross tax
revenues.
4. We will instruct the Finance Commission to take into
account factors such as demographic performance and
tax efforts in determining the shares of states in the
devolution of central tax revenues. We will work with
state governments to evolve a formula to devolve funds,
including a share of GST revenues, directly to pancha-
yats and municipalities.

RURAL AND URBAN
DEVELOPMENT
The two realities that India faces are (1) that nearly 60 per
cent of the people live in rural areas and (2) urbanisation is
taking place rapidly. Hence, we have to pay equal attention
to rural development and urban development, and provide
adequate infrastructure in our villages and towns/cities.
Some issues like livelihoods, housing, water, electricity, habitat, pollution, climate change, transport and disaster
management are common to both rural and urban areas.

37NATIONAL
SECURITY
Defence
The Chinese intrusions in Ladakh and the Galwan clash in 2020 represented the biggest setbacks to Indian national
security in decades. On 19 June 2020, PM Narendra Modi gave a clean chit to China that considerably weakened our
negotiating position. Despite 21 rounds of military-level talks, Chinese troops continue to occupy Indian territory and
deny Indian forces access to 26 out of 65 patrolling points, equivalent to an area of 2,000 square km in eastern
Ladakh. A Chinese buildup in Doklam threatens the Siliguri Corridor that connects northeast India with the rest of the
country.

INTERNAL
SECURITY
In the aftermath of the Mumbai terror attacks in
2008, Congress revamped the internal security
system and implemented a number of radical
measures. Distressingly, gaps have emerged in
the system. Besides, the increase in hate
speeches, hate crimes and communal strife
has compounded the situation.

41ENVIRONMENT
Environment, Climate Change and Disaster Management
Congress re-affirms its profound commitment to rapid, inclusive and sustainable development, and to protect its
ecosystems, local communities, flora and fauna. We recall that it was Prime Minister Indira Gandhi who first put in
place the laws, regulations and institutions for that purpose. The National Action Plan on Climate Change was
prepared under the leadership of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Despite the BJP’s misinformed criticism of the
Action Plan, the BJP/NDA government subsequently acknowledged its relevance and validity. However, there have
been several departures from the previous policies and important components such as environment protection,
forest conservation, biodiversity preservation, coastal zone regulation, wetlands protection and protection of tribal
rights have been weakened.
Air pollution and water pollution continue to extract a heavy toll on public health. Livelihoods are being destroyed in
tribal and ecologically sensitive areas.
Congress will address the issues of environment and climate change with the seriousness they deserve.

44AN APPEAL
The ten years of the BJP/NDA government have been marked by exaggeration and publicity rather than substance
and performance. The economy has registered less-than-satisfactory growth. Widespread unemployment, high
inflation and falling consumption have debilitated even this modest growth.
While the poor and the middle classes have been hit below the belt, the atmosphere in the country has become
hate-filled and divisive. Constitutional values have been pushed to the background and majoritarianism has taken
over.
Inequalities have widened. Every section of the people lives in fear.
What India and the Indian people need at this time is a decisive break from the path of the last ten years. The people
yearn to walk on the road of all-round development, equality, equity, freedom and justice. Congress has the capability
to provide the leadership to the people to walk on this new road.
The lessons of history are there before you. Congress delivered Independence. Congress laid the foundations of
democracy. Congress steered the country’s economic development through the 1950s and 1960s. Congress govern-
ments fought the wars of 1965 and 1971 and protected the sovereignty and integrity of India. Congress brought
about a paradigm change in 1991 and ushered in an era of impressive growth. In the last ten years, the Congress has
been the bulwark against illiberalism and authoritarianism. Congress has stood with the people in their fight against
injustice and oppressive laws.
Bearing in mind the lessons of history, the Congress appeals to you to repose your faith once again in the Indian
National Congress.
We promise you greater freedom, faster growth, more equitable development and justice for all. We appeal to you to
vote for the ‘Hand’ symbol and for the candidates of the Indian National Congress
It is time to remind ourselves of Tagore’s immortal words in Gitanjali:
Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high
Where knowledge is free
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments
By narrow domestic walls
Where words come out from the depth of truth
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way
Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit
Where the mind is led forward by thee
Into ever-widening thought and action
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.
