Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam
2024 General Elections Manifesto
The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) is the first party in India to have
created a tradition of publishing a manifesto before every General Election –
with a promise to implement various schemes once in power, and presenting
these commitments to the public to seek their support in the electoral arena.
The DMK has not only fulfilled the promises made to the people in these
manifestos by enacting them into laws and schemes after forming the
Government, it has continuously contributed to the progress of India by being a
pioneer and leading the way for all states at the national level through ensuring
that the Tamil language, the Tamil community, and the state of Tamil Nadu all
attain exemplary progress and identity.
It is with these sentiments that this manifesto for the 18th Indian Lok Sabha
Elections has been prepared, and will be presented to the people of Tamil Nadu
by our party’s leader, the Honourable Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.
3Let's unite!
Victory shall be ours!
We will do what we say!
We will say what we do!
Naadum Namadhae! (This is our country!)
Tamizhnattin Narpadum Namadhae! (All forty (seats) of Tamil Nadu are ours!)
The Constitution of India
The preamble of the Indian Constitution says that we, the people of India,
commit to establishing India as a secular, egalitarian republic, providing all
Indian citizens with social, economic, and political justice; the freedom to think,
write, speak, believe, and worship; and ensuring equality in status, opportunity,
and before the law; we are determined to foster a fraternity that assures the
dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.
But, for the past ten years, the BJP government has been acting against these
very principles, and hence destroying the nation.
A country built on the ideals of "Unity in Diversity", is being destroyed by the
divisive policies of the BJP government. The architects of the Constitution said
that the Constitution of India was unique because it upheld democratic
governance in the face of racial, linguistic and religious differences and united
4our diverse communities under one roof, India. Today, members of the BJP
have suggested removing the term "secular" from the Constitution to favour
Hindus, putting the very essence of the Indian constitutional framework at risk.
If the BJP comes to power again, they will do anything to destroy the nation's
secular fabric and cooperative federal structure.
Political parties across various states are uniting to form an alliance called
"INDIA" with the aim of replacing the authoritarian BJP government in the
2024 parliamentary elections.
In these circumstances, the DMK is determined that the BJP government must
be decisively defeated in the upcoming parliamentary elections. The DMK is
committed to maintaining India as a democratic federal republic. Thus, it
emphasizes electoral reforms to protect the country from fascist, religious
extremists throughout its manifesto. The BJP government's efforts are aimed at
weakening the states and reducing their share of revenues and decision-making.
Compliant States are treated as conducive; those that stand firm for their rights
are targeted as enemies. States where the BJP has not formed the Government
are treated as second-class, using the Governor, CBI, Enforcement Directorate,
and the Income Tax Department as tools to undermine the elected government's
dignity and functioning. There is also a lack of fair distribution of financial
resources, and gross interference in the states’ financial management.
The Dravidian Model of Governance
Thanks to the Dravidian Model of Governance under the leadership of the
Honourable Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Thiru. Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin,
Tamil Nadu shines as a leading state in socio-economic indicators, and in
politics. The Honourable Chief Minister has successfully implemented several
5progressive schemes that lay the path for the rest of India to follow. For
instance, through the Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thogai scheme, about 1.15
crore women in Tamil Nadu receive Rs. 1000 per month.
The Pudhumai Penn scheme grants Rs. 1000 monthly to girl students who
transition from government schools to colleges, benefiting 4.82 lakh students
annually. Similarly, the Tamil Pudhalvan scheme is being implemented so that
nearly 3 lakh boys will benefit from the monthly stipend each year.
To enhance the state’s industrial development Tamil Nadu has attracted
investments of Rs. 9.75 lakh crores from domestic and international investors,
creating employment opportunities for approximately 30 lakh youth.
The state initiated the Chief Minister’s Breakfast Scheme for children in grades
1 to 5 in government schools, a first in the nation, serving 16 lakh children daily
and ensuring their focus can remain on education. This scheme, celebrated by
the people, is set to expand to aided schools.
The government has implemented the Vidiyal Payanam (Free Bus Pass) scheme
for all women in state buses, which, according to studies, has resulted in about
447 crore cost-free bus journeys so far, enabling each beneficiary in the state to
save Rs. 888 each month on average.
To combat nutritional deficiencies in children, the Nutrition Guarantee Scheme
was introduced, thereby eliminating deficiencies in 74% of children, and
restoring them to normal health.
Nearly 28 lakh students have gained employment through vocational training
provided by the Naan Mudhalvan scheme of the Honourable Chief Minister.
6- 24.80 lakh children benefit from the Illam Thedi Kalvi post-Covid remedial
education scheme
- 1.70 crore people have benefited from the Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam
scheme for door-delivery of medicines for chronic illnesses
- 19.69 lakh people have been assisted through the Mudalvarin Mugavari
scheme for redressal of grievances by directly contacting the Office of the Chief
Minister
- 3.40 lakh petitions have been resolved under the Makkaludan Mudhalvar
scheme through which hundreds of integrated government outreach camps for
resolving long-standing problems of Citizens were run across the state
- 2 lakh people have benefitted so far from the Nammai Kakkum 48 scheme
under which the State of Tamil Nadu bears all Medical expenses for treatment
to any and all accident victims within the first 48 hours of the accident.
These are just a few of the hallmark schemes under the Dravidian model of
governance of our Honourable Chief Minister Thiru. M.K. Stalin. Many of
these initiatives are being emulated in various states under different names.
Notably, the Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thogai scheme, which provides Rs.
1000 monthly to women, has been adopted by the Karnataka state government.
The policies advocated by the great leaders of the Dravidian movement, such as
Thanthai Periyar, Arignar Anna, and Muthamizharignar Kalaignar, ensure that
every time the DMK governs, it introduces new schemes benefiting the people,
thereby advancing their welfare.
7Thanthai Periyar and Arignar Anna established the Dravidian movement based
on the noble principles of equality, fraternity and justice. Following their path,
Muthamizharignar Kalaignar transformed the DMK into a people’s movement
and served as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu five times, significantly
contributing to the state's progress in education, science, and social, economic,
and industrial development. Under his leadership, the marginalized, backward
and oppressed communities saw progress, and Tamil Nadu emerged as a leading
state in India in various human development indices.
The Justice Party, founded in 1916, awakened Tamils to their ancient history
and contemporary social injustices. Under the leadership of great leaders like
Dr. C. Natesan, Sir Pitty Thyagarayar, and Dr. T.M. Nair, the Justice Party
governed from 1920 to 1937, laying the groundwork for Tamil Nadu as the
cradle of social justice, eradicating social inequalities and oppressive practices,
and upholding self-respect.
The name of that Justice Party was changed to Dravidar Kazhagam in 1944 at
the Salem Conference following a resolution proposed by Perarignar Anna, and
it began its activities under the leadership of Thanthai Periyar. To preserve the
uniqueness of the Tamil language and to reclaim the pride of the Tamil
community, Perarignar Anna founded the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)
as a political party in 1949. Despite facing numerous obstacles and challenges
over the past 75 years, this movement has courageously encountered both
successes and failures, reaching the pinnacle of glory with unwavering heart.
Through relentless effort and various initiatives, the DMK, under the
unparalleled leadership of the Honourable Chief Minister Muthuvel
Karunanidhi Stalin, continues to achieve numerous successes. The projects
8introduced by the Honourable Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu and the benefits
they provide to the people, the accolades from newspapers and media, and the
praise from other states, have all turned attention towards Tamil Nadu,
showcasing the greatness of the Dravidian model of governance across the
entire nation today. These have guided other states towards considering Tamil
Nadu as a model state in today's parliamentary elections.
State Autonomy:
In the spirit of Peraringar Anna's principle of state autonomy, for the first time
in India, the DMK government led by the Muthamizharignar Karunanidhi
formed an expert committee in 1969 under the chairmanship of Justice
Rajamannar, including Justice Chandra Reddy and Dr. A. Lakshmanaswami
Mudaliar as members, to examine the Union-State relations. Subsequently, in
1983, the Union government constituted a committee under the leadership of
Justice Sarkaria to deliberate on Union-State relations, and again in 2000, under
the chairmanship of Justice Venkatachaliah, another committee was formed by
the Union government. Continuing this effort, when the United Progressive
Alliance came to power in the Union in 2004, the DMK pressed for actions to
grant more powers to the states, leading to the formation of a commission under
Justice M.M. Punchhi by the Union government in 2007 to re-evaluate the
Union-State relations. However, substantial resolutions to this crucial national
issue remain unaddressed and stagnant.
In keeping with this history, the DMK continues to advocate for the
recommendations of the aforementioned four committees on state autonomy, for
Union-State relations to be thoroughly debated, and for the Constitution to be
amended to grant real autonomy to the states.
9Appointment of Governors:
One of the core principles of the DMK is the redundancy of the Governor's
position. However, in practice, as the position continues, it has been
recommended by Justices M.M. Punchhi, Venkatachaliah, and Sarkaria that the
Union government should appoint state Governors through consultation with
the respective state Chief Ministers. The new government will undertake actions
to appoint Governors with the consultation of state Chief Ministers as
recommended.
The Constitution asserts equality before the law for everyone, and action will be
taken to remove Section 361 of the Indian Constitution, which gives Governors
a special exemption, thereby ensuring that Governors are also subject to legal
actions.
Abolishing of Article 356:
The DMK firmly insists on the removal of Article 356, which allows the
dissolution of duly elected state governments by President’s Rule, maintaining
its decades-long stand on this issue.
Establishing a Supreme Court Branch in Chennai:
The Indian Constitution, under Article 130, states that branches of the Supreme
Court can be established in specified locations. This was mentioned by the
retired Supreme Court Justice Mr. A.R. Lakshmanan, chair of the 12th Law
Commission, in "Law Commission Report No.230, Date: 5.8.2009."
Consequently, efforts will be made to establish a branch of the Supreme Court
in Chennai.
10Statehood for Puducherry:
Given the rapid growth in population and various other aspects of Puducherry,
the local government is unable to promptly fulfil the needs and demands of the
people due to lack of necessary powers. Considering that Mizoram, with a
smaller population, enjoys full statehood, the DMK will undertake all efforts to
ensure full statehood to Puducherry.
Language Policy:
Tamil as the Official Language:
The DMK has made countless sacrifices to preserve our mother tongue, the
classical Tamil language, and it steadfastly opposes any form of Hindi
imposition or linguistic hegemony. The party constantly emphasizes the
promise made by former Prime Minister Thiru. Jawaharlal Nehru that English
would remain the Union’s official language until the non-Hindi speaking people
desire, ensuring Hindi is not imposed on those who speak other languages.
The resolution passed in the 1996 DMK State Conference in Trichy, led by
Muthamizharignar Kalaignar, to include Tamil among the official languages of
the Union, continues to be pursued by the DMK government in the Union for
implementation.
Accordingly, for all Union government jobs and examinations conducted by
bodies like the Union Public Service Commission, the DMK will initiate actions
11to conduct written and oral examinations in Tamil and other respective state
official languages.
Tamil as a Co-Official Language in Union Government Offices in Tamil
Nadu:
Tamil will be declared as a Co-Official Language in Union government offices
in Tamil Nadu, ensuring that all Union government offices, institutions and
nationalized banks in Tamil Nadu operate in Tamil as well, with relevant
amendments to Section 343 of the Indian Constitution to be introduced by the
new government.
Equal Funding for All State Languages Including Tamil:
The Indian Constitution's Eighth Schedule mandates equal rights for all
languages in India. However, the Union government's 2023-2024 budget
allocates Rs. 1487 crores for the development of Hindi and only Rs. 74 crores
for Tamil. The new government in the Union will ensure equal funding for the
development of all state languages.
Tamil as an Official Language of the Madras High Court:
According to the Official Languages Act of 1963, Section 7, Hindi or the
respective state's official languages can be used in the judgments and orders of
the state High Courts. Following a resolution passed in the Tamil Nadu
Legislative Assembly on 6-12-2006 during Muthamizharignar Kalaignar’s
tenure as Chief Minister, it was sent to the Union government on 11-2-2007
with recommendations from the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court and the
Governor, yet the Union government has not taken any action. Thus, based on
12the resolution passed in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly, the new
government in the Union will issue orders to accept Tamil as a court language
in the Madras High Court.
Development of Tamil - Classical Language:
The Central Institute of Classical Tamil in Chennai, established through the
immense effort of Muthamizharignar Kalaignar, will continue to function
autonomously and with excellence. The new government in the Union will
further honour classical Tamil by declaring the universally revered Thirukkural
as a national text.
Citizenship for Tamils Returning Home:
Tamils affected by ethnic conflicts in Sri Lanka who sought refuge in Tamil
Nadu, and those of Indian descent known as Hill Country Tamils and their
children, housed in refugee camps since the 1964 Shastri-Sirimavo
Bandaranaike India-Sri Lanka agreement, will be facilitated to obtain Indian
citizenship.
Additionally, measures will be taken by the new Union government to grant
Indian citizenship to Sri Lankan Tamil relatives who have been permitted to
stay in camps for over 35 years. Furthermore, all necessary assistance will be
provided to those among them who wish to return to Sri Lanka.
Sethusamudram Project:
The 150-year dream project of the people of Tamil Nadu, and the southern
states, aimed at generating significant economic growth and employment
13opportunities - the grand project fought for by great leaders Kamarajar,
Perarignar Anna, and Muthamizharignar Kalaignar, is the Sethusamudram
Project. Initiated on 2nd July 2005 with an estimated cost of 2,427 crores,
significant progress was made before it was stalled by regressive forces.
The completion of the Sethusamudram Project, to ensure the economic
development of southern Tamil Nadu and to secure the nation's safety, will be a
priority for the new government formed in the union, promising decisive
actions.
Union Government Institutions:
Key institutions like the Supreme Court, the Comptroller and Auditor General,
the Central Bureau of Investigation, the Reserve Bank, the University Grants
Commission, the Indian Medical Council, the Election Commission, and the
Union government's educational boards are in peril under the BJP government.
After a change in administration, these Constitutional institutions will operate
autonomously and without political interference, as designed in the
Constitution.
BJP Government's False Promises
AIIMS Hospital
Upon assuming office in 2021, the DMK Government fulfilled its poll promise
by completing and inaugurating the Kalaignar Centennial Government Specialty
Hospital within a year, proving our commitment to action. This stands in stark
contrast to the AIIMS Hospital promised by the BJP Government, which
14remains as a mere announcement without even the beginning of Construction so
many years after the announcement.
In fact, practically none of the promises made by Prime Minister Modi during
the 2014 parliamentary elections have been fulfilled in the past ten years.
Some more instances of Prime Minister Modi’s failure to deliver on promises
include:
1. In a rally in Ramanathapuram, he promised to form a committee to
address the issues of Tamil Nadu fishermen with Sri Lanka, and Gujarat
fishermen with Pakistan; it was not formed.
2. He promised to bring back black money stored overseas and deposit ₹15
lakhs in every Indian's bank account; it was not done.
3. He promised satellite facilities for fishermen to locate abundant fish
stocks; the facility was not provided.
4. He stated in Ramanathapuram that a strong Prime Minister like him
would prevent attacks on Tamil Nadu fishermen by Sri Lanka. In reality,
such attacks have only increased.
5. During his 2014 visit to Erode, PM Modi promised to brighten the lives
of turmeric farmers; it did not happen.
6. In Tirupur, he mentioned setting up a common effluent treatment plant
for dyeing and bleaching industries to aid the textile industry; it was not
established.
157. In Salem, he promised to modernize the steel plant; it has not been
modernized.
8. He promised to enhance the lives of tapioca producers; it was not
fulfilled.
9. He assured special facilities for marketing farmers' products; it was not
done.
10. During his visit to Krishnagiri, Modi said the region was underdeveloped
and promised progress; But, no scheme was initiated for Krishnagiri.
11. In Kanyakumari, Modi promised to transform it into a world-renowned
tourist destination; But, no action was taken towards this.
12. He claimed to retrieve black money within India amounting to
approximately ₹5 lakh crores by demonetizing ₹500 and ₹1000 notes.
Other than leading to long queues at banks and deaths, there was no
benefit at all. The same scenario was repeated when the ₹2000 notes were
also declared as invalid.
13. He promised employment opportunities for 2 crore youth annually; he
has not delivered even a small fraction of this.
BJP Government's Corruption:
The CAG report has revealed 7 major instances of corruption under the BJP,
including the Bharatmala project, Dwarka expressway construction project, toll
16collection issues, Ayushman Bharat scheme, Ayodhya development project,
Ministry of Rural Development's pension scheme, and HAL's aircraft design
project, indicating corruption involving several crores in these projects.
The BJP government agreed to purchase French Rafale jets at a price 41%
higher than the price set by the previous UPA government led by Congress,
showing a significant discrepancy in the procurement cost.
Election Deception:
The cost of cooking gas cylinders was raised from ₹400 to ₹1000, only to be
slightly reduced by ₹100 around election time, demonstrating a pattern of
electoral deception.
Destruction of State Powers by the BJP Government:
The BJP government aims to weaken the states by seizing their financial
autonomy, crucial for their development.
Lack of Funding for the Chennai Metro Rail Project:
The Union Government and the Tamil Nadu Government are to implement the
second phase of the Chennai Metro Rail project in Tamil Nadu on a 50:50
partnership basis. So far, the Union Government has not provided any funding
for the project. Moreover, the approval for the project has been pending in the
Union Cabinet meeting for more than one and a half years. This year, the Tamil
Nadu Government has allocated an additional Rs. 12,000 crores for the project.
The BJP government is hindering development by not properly allocating funds
to Tamil Nadu.
17The BJP Government is Devoid of Basic Humanity:
On December 2 and 3, 2023, the districts of Chennai, Thiruvallur,
Kanchipuram, and Chengalpattu were devastated by Cyclone Michaung and
subsequent rains, causing significant distress to the people. Similarly, on
December 17 and 18, the districts of Thoothukudi, Tirunelveli, Tenkasi and
Kanyakumari were severely affected by heavy rains, leading to extensive
damage. The state government provided solace to the affected people, rendering
necessary relief efforts. Financial assistance was given, offering Rs. 6000 to the
most affected families and Rs. 1000 to those with minor damages, in addition to
increasing the compensation for human fatalities, livestock losses and crop
damages, under the Dravidian model of governance.
The Honourable Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Thiru. MK Stalin, on December
19, 2023, met the Prime Minister in New Delhi, requesting financial aid for
flood relief. Despite the Union Defence Minister Thiru. Rajnath Singh and the
Union Finance Minister Tmt. Nirmala Sitharaman's announcements, and the
visit of central government teams to the affected areas in Chennai and
Thoothukudi, not a single paisa has been provided by the Union Government
for rain flood relief to Tamil Nadu so far.
The Chief Minister had requested a relief fund of Rs. 37,000 crores for repairing
damages to infrastructure and roads caused by the floods, through a letter to the
Prime Minister. However, the Prime Minister, ignoring all requests, did not
even visit the flood-affected regions. In contrast, BJP-ruled states like Gujarat
and Uttarakhand received immediate financial assistance from the National
Disaster Management Fund.
18Revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's Special Status:
The special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 was
abolished, and the state was bifurcated into two union territories, stripping it of
its statehood. The promise of running elections for the bifurcated State & Union
Terroitory have not been fulfilled. These move by the BJP government indicate
an intent to dismantle the rights of states and the structure of statehood itself.
New Education Policy:
Introduced in 2020, the New Education Policy goes against the principle of
unity in diversity, coercing a policy that undermines the freedom of Indian
citizens. It threatens national unity by imposing Hindi and Sanskrit.
Separate Budget for Railways:
Since 2017, the Union Government has abolished the separate Railway Budget,
merging it with the General Budget. The new government will ensure Railways
will have a separate budget. Following the introduction of high-speed trains like
Vande Bharat, fares have skyrocketed, making it unaffordable for the middle
class and poor. The increase in fares for sleeper class with AC facilities and the
cancellation of concessions for senior citizens have significantly
inconvenienced patients and the elderly. Hence, for better management and to
facilitate integration with future metro and railway expansions due to population
growth and new cities, the railway administration should be gradually
transferred to state governments.
Reservation:
19It is imperative to immediately implement a 33% reservation for women in
Parliament. The current reservation system in the union government has not
achieved its purpose due to non-adherence in various sectors, leading to
complaints of discrimination and harassment against Scheduled Castes,
Scheduled Tribes, and other backward students by upper-class teachers and
students in higher education institutions. To ensure the proper implementation
of reservations for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe students in these
institutions, advisory councils will be established at the state level to monitor
compliance.
The DMK, when it was a part of the National Front government in 1990,
notably contributed to the establishment of a 27% reservation in Union
government jobs following the Mandal Commission recommendations, pushed
by Muthamizharingar Kalaignar. This period also saw the establishment of a
tribunal for the Cauvery water dispute and an inter-state council. The Chennai
airport named its international terminal after Arignar Anna and its domestic
terminal after Kamaraj.
Following its participation in the United Front government in 1996 and the
National Democratic Alliance government in 1999, the DMK has continued to
work towards establishing stable governance in the Union and advocated for
equality, social justice, communal harmony, state autonomy, linguistic rights,
poverty eradication, and economic development.
The DMK's contributions to Tamil Nadu's development were significant during
its time in the United Progressive Alliance government led by the Congress
party from 2004 to 2013. Thiru. Murasoli Maran, serving as the Union Minister
for Commerce and Industry, was praised internationally for his efforts to protect
Indian agriculture during World Trade Organization negotiations in Doha.
20The classification of India's public sector enterprises based on their performance
and the announcement of the best-performing ones as 'Navaratnas' were highly
commended, along with efforts to improve the efficiency of other public sector
enterprises. The establishment of the World Trade Organization's Intellectual
Property Rights office in Chennai is also credited to him.
Since the United Progressive Alliance government in 2004, efforts by the party
ministers have brought various benefits to Tamil Nadu, including:
- The declaration of Tamil as a classical language; establishment of the Central
Institute of Classical Tamil in Chennai.
- The Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project with an expenditure of Rs. 2427
crore.
- Development of 3276 kilometres of four-lane roads out of 4676 kilometres of
national highways at a cost of Rs. 56,664.21 crores through the Shipping and
Highways Department, including massive bridges, port expansion works, cargo
container terminals, and waterways transport facilities.
- A National Automotive Testing and R&D Infrastructure Project at Oragadam
near Chennai at an investment of Rs. 470 crores.
- Upgrading the Salem Steel Plant to international standards and creating a new
cold rolling mill with an expenditure of Rs. 1553 crores.

"Super Specialty" medical college at a cost of Rs. 120 crores.
- The commencement of the elevated road project between Chennai Port and

water costing Rs. 908 crores.
- Approval to convert all meter gauge railway tracks in Tamil Nadu into broad

crores.
22- A central university in Thiruvarur.

Guarantee Act.
- Removal of "cenVAT tax" for the benefit of weaver community.
- Repeal of the POTA law.
- The first to introduce third-generation Information Technology (3G) in India,
comparable to developed countries.
- National e-Governance Program to establish complete computerized
administration in all villages.
- Facility to talk on the phone across India for 50 paise.
- 27 percent reservation for backward classes in Union-funded educational
institutions.
- Union Government waived off loans and interests worth Rs. 72,000 crores in
cooperative banks and agricultural loans across India.
23- Hundreds of crores of rupees in educational loans for students across India.
- Modernization of the Indian Postal Department, introducing multi-purpose
"Project Arrow" in 15,000 post offices; 300 post offices in Tamil Nadu were
upgraded under this scheme.
In contrast, not a single beneficial project has been implemented in Tamil Nadu
in the last 10 years (2014-2024). Therefore, we vow to remove the BJP
government that has led the country towards destruction with a fascist religious
zeal, and establish an "INDIA" alliance government.
The following promises will be implemented after the formation of the
“INDIA” alliance government:
1. Waiving off loans and interests for farmers in nationalised and scheduled
banks.
2. Waiver of educational loans for students.
3. A monthly entitlement of Rs. 1000 for all women in every state.
4. Formation of State Development Council including Chief Ministers.
5. Re-establishing the Planning Commission, dissolved by the BJP government,
to draft plans based on the requests of state governments across India, replacing
the current NITI Aayog.
6. Exemption for Tamil Nadu from the NEET exam.
247. Complete removal of toll booths on national highways.
8. Roads and connecting roads in industrial areas will be expanded into concrete

9. Legal amendments will be made to ensure state governments, elected by the
people, appoint Vice-Chancellors to universities, rather than Governors.
10. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA-2019) will be repealed.
11. College students will receive a free SIM card with One GB data per month.
12. 50% reservation in Union Government higher education institutions for

in India.
22. Tourist facilities will be enhanced in towns near major pilgrimage sites to
attract more visitors.
23. The Robert Caldwell Language Research Centre will be established in India.

will be taken to reclaim Kachchatheevu to ensure India's security and to protect
the welfare of the fishermen.
2628. State status will be restored to the bifurcated Jammu and Kashmir, and
democratic elections will be conducted for the state legislature immediately.
29. The livelihood of the people of Kashmir will be improved.
30. The introduction of the Uniform Civil Code will be strictly prevented to
preserve the secular nature of India as stated in the Constitution's preamble.
31. A committee will be formed to ensure representation for all states in the
UPSC committee.

In this election manifesto, we pledge to implement all the plans outlined, which
will contribute to the progress of Tamil Nadu and the development of India.
Candidates contesting under the DMK alliance as members of Parliament will
continuously strive to fulfil these promises to the people.
The AIADMK's anti-people and anti-Tamil actions:
During its ten-year rule in Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK led the state to the bottom
in industrial development in India. Contrary to the Tamil language and ethnic
sentiments, it supported the BJP's "One Nation, One X" (Language, Election,
Education Policy, etc.) slogans, acting against the overall development of Tamil
Nadu. Similarly, by voting against the amendment proposed by the DMK to
include Sri Lankan Tamils in the Citizenship Amendment Act, and by providing
its crucial votes for the passage of the current version of the CAA, it showed its
antipathy to both Sri Lankan Refugees, and Secularism in India.
Tamil Nadu and its people know well the record of achievements when the
DMK was in the Union Government and even when it ruled the state. We assure
that the trust and expectations placed in the DMK will be met without fail, and
we will work diligently to ensure the progress of Tamil Nadu and India through
this election manifesto.
Therefore, let the fascist rule be banished! We are ready to work tirelessly to
maintain India's secular nature. Command us, and we will establish a secular
alliance government in India! We will foster harmony among religions! We will
67protect human rights! We will champion social justice and equality! We will
enhance industrial prosperity! We will achieve global acclaim in economic
development! We will work incessantly for Democracy to flourish! Let us unite
and succeed!
Long live Tamil Nadu! Victory to India!
