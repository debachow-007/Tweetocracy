terms of mindset.
Your aspiration is our mission. Your dreams are our responsibility.
Today, our youth are speaking of creating Viksit Bharat by 2047 as a goal that is attainable, as a milestone
that will certainly be reached. The nation is confident on its journey of becoming self-reliant (Aatmanirbhar).
Let us create a nation that future generations will be proud of!
This is a big change from the atmosphere of desperation and frustration that the nation had experienced in
the decade prior to 2014 due to the corruption, policy paralysis and misrule by the government of those
times.

We have gone from a nation that was in the ‘Fragile Five’ to a nation that is one of the top 5 economies of

the world. The most important facet of this progress is that the fruits of development reached everyone,
especially those who needed it the most. The mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Narendra Modi
Prayas has guided our actions.
The nation’s growth has been powered by the victory of 25 crore people in the battle against poverty. These
are people who had suffered decades of deprivation of even basic necessities. Today, not only are they
benefiting from our saturation approach in basic needs like bank accounts, gas connections, toilets, water,
electricity, etc, but they are also being empowered with new-age facilities like optic fibre connections, digital
solutions, drones, etc.
The nation’s growth has come from the drastic socio-economic transformation seen in the lives of women,
farmers, fisherfolks, street vendors, small entrepreneurs, SC, ST and OBC communities. They are being
directly empowered through the power of technology such as the JAM trinity.
Farmers have been a backbone of our nation’s progress. Whether it is historic MSP hikes, massive rise in
procurement or making fertilisers available to them inexpensively despite globally high prices, direct income
support through PM-KISAN, safety net of Fasal Bima, renewed focus on millets, expanded access to local and
global markets, a number of steps have been taken to empower them. Our Annadatas are also becoming
Urjadatas due to the PM KUSUM scheme. Empowered by our Beej Se Bazar Tak approach, our farmers have
done wonders for the country.
The nation’s growth has been fueled by our focus on Vikas and Virasat.
India has been setting new benchmarks in growth of both ecology and economy.

2President’s
Note
My Dear Brothers and Sisters,
The philosophy of “Antyodaya” has been Bharatiya Janata Party’s guiding light since its foundation. This has
manifested itself in various programmes launched by our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji aimed at Garib
Kalyan.
In just ten years, our government has achieved path-breaking milestones. With Sabka Saath and Sabka Prayas,
we are committed towards nation-building and promise to ensure Sabka Vikas by strengthening Sabka
Vishwas in the BJP government. Modi ki Guarantee 2024 Sankalp Patra is our resolve to continue this progress
and progress forward in our journey.
As we enter Amrit Kaal of Bharat, a new Vision is now in front of us, a Vision driven by the Panch Pran
enunciated by our Prime Minister. The General Elections of 2024 will be crucial in defining the course of our
country. 97 crore voters have made up their minds. Citizens want to go forward. Everyone wants to build the
country. People have decided to defeat the corrupt alliances.
In just ten years, all of us have worked to bring Bharat from Fragile 5 to place it among the Top 5 economies.
We are secure and safe today because we have a leader who is decisive and bold. We are building world class
infrastructure because we have a leader who believes in long term vision. We are building an equitable society
because we have a leader who cares. Modi ki Guarantee is for all sectors and all 140 crore citizens.
We have embraced our rich heritage and diverse culture. Bhavya Ram Mandir in Ayodhya has rejuvenated our
society. Our cultural and religious sites are being restored across the country. Our young citizens are finding a
new interest in our history and heritage.
Today our voice is being respected on all global platforms because we have a leader who puts Bharat First in all
international affairs. We are trusted. We are attracting global value chains. We are becoming co-creators of
technology.
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been fulfilling our aspirations since 2014. And today, ten years later, we
once again seek your vote and support to build the Viksit Bharat that we all have dreamed for. We seek your
full support to bring a massive majority to BJP and Narendra Modiji.
Vande Mataram!
Shri Jagat Prakash Nadda
National President, BJP
3Sankalp Patra
Note
My Dear Brothers and Sisters,
As we stand at the cusp of a transformational era in this country, it is a matter of immense pride and
gratification for me to present to you the Modi Ki Guarantee 2024 Sankalp Patra. We have realised the
importance and significance of this document and the immense responsibility that was placed upon us to
define the Vision of Viksit Bharat. It is our hope that this document captures the essence of the aspirations of
the 140 crore Bharatiyas.
The Sankalp Patra has been prepared after elaborate and intensive discussions with people across different
classes, communities and regions. We have made sure that each and every section of the society was heard
and was able to share with us their aspirations. We express our sincere gratitude to each and every Bharatiya
who has given us their suggestions to us through our Viksit Bharat campaign. Your suggestions have made this
document immensely richer.
This Sankalp Patra is the PM Modi’s guarantee that we will work tirelessly to realise your dreams and
aspirations. The nation has witnessed immense progress and development in the last 10 years in this
government under the visionary leadership of PM Shri Narendra Modi. This Sankalp Patra is being presented
before the 140 crore Bharatiya at a time when Bharat is taking great leaps across all the sectors, ensuring
welfare of all its citizens. It is this delivery that inspires unwavering confidence in every Modi ki Guarantee
among the people of Bharat.
When the BJP government came into power in 2014, it faced the daunting task of reviving the stalled
development caused by widespread corruption, ineffective governance, and indecision during the tenure of
the previous government. Under the previous government, the nation had plunged into despair due to a lack
of clear intentions, weak leadership, and a dearth of policies aimed at public welfare. Over the past ten years,
we have managed to steer the country away from the troubles inherited from a decade of mismanagement by
the previous government, while also accelerating the pace of development.
The second term of the NDA government under the leadership of PM Shri Narendra Modi is proof that the
hopes of 140 crore Bharatiya have transformed into a solid trust and confidence.
I would like to appeal to you to join hands with us and support us in the upcoming elections so that our
collective dream of Viksit Bharat is realised.
Vande Mataram!
